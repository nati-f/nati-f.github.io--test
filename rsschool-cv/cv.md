### Summary

**Goal**
Build a career in mobile development for iOS. Make useful, easy and affordable applications for users.

**Wishes**
Since we are just starting to take the course, my main goals are:
* go through all stages of training;
* submit all homework on time;
* read some books on iOS development;
* make some interesting applications;
* help students with questions if I can help with an answer.

**Important for me**
It is important for me to **make useful applications** for users that will help **optimize their time** and **help simplify life**. Therefore, I want to **make lightweight applications** that are useful in any incomprehensible situation.

**I want**
I want to create my own projects and work in a friendly and growing company with large development budgets, because an experienced team helps not to stand still and constantly develop, and large budgets will allow you to purchase top products from Apple and keep up with the times and conquer it.

**Self-presentation**
Lack of experience Junior Developer sells his/her potential, his/her passion and ability to learn fast. You shouldn't think that everybody is going to teach you when you come to the workplace . Rather being a Junior means always
learning new things from everywhere etc.).
